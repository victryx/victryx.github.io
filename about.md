## About me

I started programming in 2020 during the global pandemic because I wanted to make games. I studied an app development higher education course for two years and then got into university. I did an internship at a web development company in 2024, working on an internal time tracking project developed with React and Next.js.

I enjoy playing around with game development tools and ocassionally I make games.

### Learning

- **Jekyll**, for this very same website
- **Godot** game engine
- **C++** ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€
- **CSS**, by accident
- **Math**, to my dismay
- I'm trying to switch to **Neovim** from vscode, but that's going to take a while
- Not related, but I'm also learning to draw

### Likes

Some of my favorite games are **Age of Empires II**, **Vanquish**, and **Fallout New Vegas**

### Now

- **Reading** _Brave New World_ by Aldous Huxley
- **Playing** Fez
