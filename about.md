## About me

I started programming in 2020 during the global pandemic because I wanted to make games. I studied an app development higher education course for two years and then got into university. I did an internship at a web development company in 2024, working on an internal time tracking project developed with React and Next.js.

I enjoy playing around with game development tools and ocassionally I make games.

### Learning

- **Jekyll**, for this very same website
- **Godot** game engine
- **C++** ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€
- **CSS**, by accident
- **Math**, to my dismay
- I'm trying to switch to **Neovim** from vscode, but that's going to take a while
- Not related, but I'm also learning to draw

### Skills

- **SRUM**, agile methodologies
- **Java**, Hibernate, Spring Boot
- Android/iOS apps with **Flutter** 
- **HTML** and **CSS**
- Problem Solving
- Time management

I've also built basic projects using **Wordpress** and **PHP** and I have worked with **Symfony**, **React** and **Next.js**.

## About the website

This website is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. I'm using a modified version of [this](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console) theme.
